Learning languages is hard. This projects aim is to help.

## Domain Language

- `Token` refers to a singular word of a phrase, that contains
  - a `source_text`
  - a `lemma`
  - a `pos` (part of speech, such as `NOUN`). [Reference](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html).
  - a `feature_set` (a set of features, such as `NUMBER=PLURAL` and `CASE=GEN`). [Reference](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html).
  - an optional `ancestor` (a reference to another `Token` in the phrase that it relates to).

- `Phrase` refers to a collection of `Tokens` that form a sentence.

- A `SemanticTranslation` is a `Phrase` that is a translation of another `Phrase`. The _meaning_
of the original phrase is preserved as well as possible in the translation.
It consists of a `source_phrase` and a `target_phrase`.

- A `LiteralTranslation` is a direct, literal translation of a phrase. This can help users better
understand how phrases are constructed. It consists of the `source phrase` and a collection of
`TokenTranslations`, which are a key-value pair of tokens from the source phrase and their
directly translated counterparts. For example, "Ich bin ein Student" would contain four translated
tokens: `(Ich, I)`, `(bin, am)`, `(ein, a)`, `(Student, student)`.

- `Tokens` are aggregated through the process of literally translating and grammatically analyzing
phrases. These processes return Sets of `TokenTranslations` and `TokenMorphology` respectively,
which are coalesced into `Tokens` that ultimately make up a `Phrase`.
Therefore, a `FullAnalysis` consists of a set of `Tokens` holding their literal translation
and grammatical analysis, as well as the semantic translation of the phrase.

## Part of Speech & Features

- `Part of Speech` (POS) is a grammatical category of words that have similar grammatical properties.

- `Features` are morphological and syntactic properties of words. They are used to distinguish
between different grammatical categories of words. Read more: https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html
