## Domain Language

- `Token` refers to a singular word of a phrase, that contains
  - a `source_text`
  - a `lemma`
  - a `pos` (part of speech, such as `NOUN`). [Reference](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html).
  - a `feature_set` (a set of features, such as `NUMBER=PLURAL` and `CASE=GEN`). [Reference](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html).
  - an optional `ancestor` (a reference to another `Token` in the phrase that it relates to).

- `Phrase` refers to a collection of `Tokens` that form a sentence.

- A `SemanticTranslation` is a `Phrase` that is a translation of another `Phrase`. The _meaning_
of the original phrase is preserved as well as possible in the translation.
It consists of a `source_phrase` and a `target_phrase`.

- A `LiteralTranslation` is a direct, literal translation of a word. This can help users better
understand how phrases are constructed. It consists of the `source phrase` and a collection of
`translated tokens`, which are a key-value pair of tokens from the source phrase and their
directly translated counterparts. For example, "Ich bin ein Student" would contain four translated
tokens: `(Ich, I)`, `(bin, am)`, `(ein, a)`, `(Student, student)`.
